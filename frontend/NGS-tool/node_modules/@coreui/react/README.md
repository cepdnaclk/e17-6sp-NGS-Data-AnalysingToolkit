## Quick start

### Instalation

Several quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-react/archive/v4.1.2.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/coreui/coreui-react.git`
- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install @coreui/react`
- Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add @coreui/react`

Read the [Getting started page](https://coreui.io/react/docs/getting-started/introduction/) for information on the framework contents, templates and examples, and more.

### Stylesheets

React components are styled using `@coreui/coreui` CSS library, but you can use them also with bootstrap CSS library. That is possible because `@coreui/coreui` library is compatible with bootstrap, it just extends its functionalities. The only exception are custom CoreUI components, which don't exist in the Bootstrap ecosystem.

#### CoreUI CSS files

##### Installation

```bash
yarn add @coreui/coreui
```

or

```bash
npm install @coreui/coreui --save
```

##### Basic usage

```js
import '@coreui/coreui/dist/css/coreui.min.css'
```

#### Bootstrap CSS files

##### Installation

```bash
yarn add bootstrap
```

or

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```

##### Basic usage

```js
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
```
